An attempt at porting the "simple-shm" demo client in the wayland-demos 
repository to Go. Currently, it does paint to the screen, but only does it 
once.

This is some of the worst code I've ever written and is strictly meant as a 
"Hey it can be done" sort of thing.

So far, while this is working, I still considered it a failed experiment. 
Primarily because the Wayland libraries use C function pointers gratuitously, 
and cgo cannot deal with these elegantly.

Moreover, all of the "callback" functions (prefixed with "go...") must be 
exported, and for whatever reason, the Wayland structs are not being properly 
translated to Go types. Thus, the callback functions must be stripped of all 
struct parameters, and data must be passed using unsafe.Pointer. Not pretty.

for a more in depth description of the exporting problem.
